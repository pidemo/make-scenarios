# make-scenarios
A collection of Make Scenarios Blueprints (in JSON)

Download any of the JSON files to quickly get started in Make.
Once downloaded, click on "Import Scenario" inside of Make, and select the desired JSON file.
After that, you will just have to create/remap your connections, maybe remap some variables, and you'll be good to go !

Have fun building ðŸ˜Ž
